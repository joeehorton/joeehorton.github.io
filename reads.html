      <p>[reads] is a monthly curated book subscription service based in New York. It is built on the idea that learning should be universal and lifelong. I joined the team as a remote Developer Intern in May 2018.<br><br>Immediate tasks included reading up on Shopify and becoming familiar with Liquid. With little knowledge of Liquid, I was mentored by Developer partner Michael Ray.<br><br>The main problem that I worked on during my internship was the improvement of the desktop and mobile experience across the site. This including cleaning up snippets of code, CSS tweaks and coming up with alternative designs.<br><br>The best way to go about this was for Rachael and Emma (creators of [reads]) to create tickets on Github. I would then work my way through the tickets, taking into account their priority. We would hold weekly google hangout sessions allowing me to walk through my design fixes and code for review by Rachael, Emma and Michael.<br><br>Close to the end of the internship, with my past experience in design, I was able to work on creating new designs that would be implemented across the site.<br><br>My time at [reads] was incredibly rewarding. Not only was I part of an inspiring team, but I also learnt the importance of communication and transparency when working remotely.</p>
