      <p>Pureprint Group is one of the largest commercial printers in the country. I was taken on as a Junior Developer but in time also took on the role of Designer. The majority of the projects that I was involved in were to design and develop MVC (Model, View, Controler) forms for active and potential clients to estimate the cost of a project and guide them in sending their data to the print team.<br><br>Their current forms and web apps were outdated in their design and they were looking for me to re-design and develop new content to an MVP (Minimum Viable Product), which would reflect the current trends in design.<br><br>The timeframe for each project was limited. Because of this, I used Bootstrap for layout and structure, which allowed me to give more attention to the design.<br><br>Although I was also not able to work alongside a copywriter or UX designer to form consistent language and information architecture across the projects, I learnt an incredible amount in such a short time. This was largely due to a fantastic mentor, Ali Shah, and also being given 100% responsibility for the design and front-end development of each project.<br><br>The work below is a selection of some of the projects that I was fortunate enough to work on during my time at Pureprint.</p>
