      <p>This was a job that I was offered, but I was unable to take it up at the time. I came back to it at a later date to have a think about what I would have done...<br><br>MoonPod is a zero-gravity beanbag that was sucessfully funded on Kickstarter in 15 minutes. The problem was that their current site did not reflect the feel and look of their product. With a detailed brief provided, the job had a time frame of 30 hours to design and develop (front-end) a one-page website with a key focus on customer conversion.<br><br>I began by re-reading the brief and looking at websites and other material that the client particularly liked. Websites such as buffy.co and casper.com were just a couple. Thinking about why the client liked a design rather than details of the design itself was an important consideration. Buffy and Casper seemed to explore similar ideas: a drive towards conversion, a light and warm colour scheme and soft, rounded typefaces.<br><br>I decided to work off their current site’s layout structure and focused on the typography and colour scheme. Going for a typeface such as Shrikhand for large headings and Poppins for paragraphs and buttons gave the design a more playful and softer feel.<br><br>“Float on Moon Pod; a zero-gravity beanbag engineered to deliver a full-body weightless sensation for all-day stress relief + relaxation”<br><br>This is how MoodPod describe their product. Words such as ‘weightless,’ ‘relief,’ and ‘float’ were concepts I wanted to use in the design and feel of the site. With that in mind, I decided to use a warm colour pallette with big, heavy, rounded typefaces and white rounded buttons with a drop-shadow to imitate the MoonPod’s weightless sensation. I wanted the user to arrive on the landing page and think “I want to lie down on a MoodPod.”<br><br>The design and code of the one-page design took me short of 30 hours. Given a longer time frame, CSS animation and user-interaction would create, I think, an even more playful and inviting site. </p>
